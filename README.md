# Medicine_recommendation System with Machine Learning
<br>
a powerful platform designed to assist users in understanding and managing their health. Leveraging the capabilities of machine learning, our system analyzes user-input symptoms to predict potential diseases accurately.
<br>
This system allows users to input their symptoms, and with a simple click of a button, it predicts: 🔹 Disease Name
🔹 Description
🔹 Precautions
🔹 Medication
🔹 Workouts
🔹 Diet Recommendations
