# Medicine_recommendation System with Machine Learning
<br>
a powerful platform designed to assist users in understanding and managing their health. Leveraging the capabilities of machine learning, our system analyzes user-input symptoms to predict potential diseases accurately.
<br>
This system allows users to input their symptoms, and with a simple click of a button, it predicts:<br> ðŸ”¹ Disease Name
<br>ðŸ”¹ Description
<br>ðŸ”¹ Precautions
<br>ðŸ”¹ Medication
<br>ðŸ”¹ Workouts
<br>ðŸ”¹ Diet Recommendations
<br>
Built using Supervised Learning (Support Vector Machine - SVM) and a front-end design powered by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This project aims to streamline healthcare services and improve patient care by providing fast and accurate predictions.
